###What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

	Prior to the session I was unclear about merging and pushing files, and, where that was all taking place in the terminal or on GitHub.  

###What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

	I feel confident about creating branches, working on them and commiting files. I understand merging the working branch now with the master.

###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

	We talked about cloning the correct folders to the desktop as there was some initial confusion about that as well as adding a contributer and pull requests in GitHub.

###What still confuses you about Git?

	I'm not 100% on the git fetch and git merge syntax and where those are coming from. At this point I was the navigator and not the driver, so I wasn't physically entering the commands at this point.


###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?


	It was alright.  The latter part of the assignment was where we needed some clarification which exceeded the time our pairing lead could stay.  It is difficult to coordinate when we were both confused about why something wasn't working. It's also hard for me to follow along when I am not typing or we have to stop and back track.
